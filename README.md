# Supabase Pause Prevention

🛑 Stop Supabase projects from pausing due to inactivity! :raised_hands:

> On the free-tier plan, projects that are inactive for more than 7 days are paused. 


## Solution / How it works

- Creating a _cron job_ (scheduled task) that makes a simple database call
  - _(This keeps your Supabase project active)_
- Fetching `keep-alive.ts` API endpoints for the other projects, as Vercel limits free-tier users to one cron job.

## Getting Started

**Super simple to add to your existing Supabase project!**

### Configure your main project

_Only 3 files matter_

- [`/app/api/keep-alive/route.ts`](app/api/keep-alive/route.ts) - API endpoint the cron job will execute
- [`/app/api/keep-alive/helper.ts`](app/api/keep-alive/helper.ts) - Helper functions called from `route.ts`
- [`/config/keep-alive-config.ts`](config/keep-alive-config.ts) - Configuration for your setup
- [`/vercel.json`](vercel.json) - Directs Vercel to periodically run the `keep-alive` endpoint

`utils/supabase` folder contains files provided in the Supabase docs for the [Next.js Web App demo — Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/tutorials/with-nextjs)

Everything else is boilerplate from Next.js `create-next-app`

### Configuring your other Supabase projects

After selecting your primary project _(the one that implements the code provided in this repository)_, you'll want to add an API endpoint to your other Supabase projects

The only requirement is that this endpoint is reachable and makes a call to your Supabase database


> [!NOTE]
> API endpoint must make database call   
> Ensure the server doesn't cache this

<summary>Example of a setup using Prisma as an ORM</summary>

`/pages/api/keep-alive.ts` 

```typescript
// Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
import { prisma } from 'src/server/db'
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default async function handler(
  _req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  try {
    const dbResponse = await prisma.tag.findMany()
    const successMessage = (dbResponse != null && dbResponse?.length > 0) ? "Success" : "Fail"
    res.status(200).json(successMessage)
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(401).send("There was an error")
  }
}
```
</details>

### Sample SQL 

Any table and column can be called, but if you'd rather go with a generic, here's a SQL query for a `keep-alive` table 

```sql
CREATE TABLE "keep-alive" (
  id BIGINT generated BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  name text NULL DEFAULT '':: text,
  random uuid NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid (),
  CONSTRAINT "keep-alive_pkey" PRIMARY key (id)
);

INSERT INTO
  "keep-alive"(name)
VALUES
  ('placeholder'),
  ('example');
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is now **strongly recommended** to use a `keep-alive` table like the one above.   
> This is in light of the added features for _optional_ database insertion & deletion actions

### Sample response

Visiting `https://your-project-domain.vercel.app/api/keep-alive` 

```
Results for retrieving
'mzmgylpviofc' from 'keep-alive' at column 'name': []

Other Endpoint Results:
https://your-other-vercel-project-urls.vercel.app/api/keep-alive - Passed
https://your-other-supabase-app.com/api/keep-alive - Passed

```

<details>
<summary>Extended response (with insertion / deletion)</summary>
  
```
Results for retrieving entries from 'keep-alive' - 'name column: [{"name":"placeholder"},{"name":"random"}, ... ,{"name":"uujyzdnsbrgi"}]

Results for deleting
'uujyzdnsbrgi' from 'keep-alive' at column 'name': success
```
